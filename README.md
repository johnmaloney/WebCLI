# WebCLI
This is a web based console that can be extended by adding project specific commands

## Goals
1. There is a core library that allows for a module library to add the following items:
  1a. Commands - loaded from a modules commands file, this will be the text commands entered in the UI
  1b. Command Metadata - data about the command including samples and documentation
  1c. Environments - differing environments to execute commands within e.g. prod, staging, dev
  1d.
